# Elm sound example

This repository contains an example project for the implementation of sounds in elm. Elm does not have a pure solution for sounds, therefore ports with some javascript are used.

If you want to update the `elm.js` file you have to execute the following line:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js
```


Feel free to create pull requests if you find any bugs.

In the project three different songs are used. The sources for the songs are the following:
1. https://github.com/flofe104/elmlord (https://github.com/flofe104)
2. https://www.hifi-online.net/sound-downloads/ (Drum-Solo Mono)
3. https://freesound.org/people/Disquantic/sounds/525290/ (Disquantic)
